# Election Analysis
**Project Overview**
 \
This project uses Python to analyze 369,712 ballets and determine:
 \
1. the winner of a Colorado election, 
2. the proportion and number of votes that each candidate won,
3. the proportion and number of votes that each county cast.
 \
**Results**
\
Three contestents and three counties competed in the election. A total of 369,712 voters participated. The winner was Diana DeGette. She won 73.8% of the vote with 272,892 ballets. Charles Stockham came in second (23% of the vote). Raymon Doane brought up the rear (3.1% of the vote). Denver county submited the most ballets (306,055). This means it had nearly 8x more voters than Jefferson or Arapahoe County.\
**Recommendations**
 \
To use the script at scale, the following checks are recommended:
 \
A. Make sure to capture a distinct count.\
For example:
This code uses if statements to achieve a distinct count.\
